// expo-font loadAsync, which can never succeed in this app: the APK ships
// no res/raw or res/font, so the native asset lookup fails, and the
// failure is swallowed (no catch, no retry) — the component then renders
// an empty Text forever. React Native's own font fallback resolves this
// family straight from assets/fonts/<family>.ttf, which the build ships
// when the file is required below (preview-14 proved the point by
// omission: with no require left, Metro dropped the feather file from
// the APK entirely and only 3 .ttf remained).

// Bare require on purpose: it forces Metro to include the project-local
// Feather file in the APK as assets/fonts/assets_fonts_feather.ttf (the
// flattened project-asset name, as preview-13 already demonstrated).
// The value is never used — the family name above is what renders it.

// Codepoints from @expo/vector-icons' Feather glyph map. Feather has no
// lightbulb glyph, so the Ide tab uses zap as its stand-in.
